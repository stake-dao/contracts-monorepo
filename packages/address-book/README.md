# <h1 align="center">Stake DAO Address Book</h1>

This package provides the canonical, up-to-date mapping of all protocol and product smart contract addresses used by Stake DAO and its ecosystem. It serves as the **source of truth** for addresses referenced by other smart contract packages, scripts, and off-chain integrations.

## üìö What is this package for?

- **Centralized Address Management:**
  All protocol, DAO, and product addresses are maintained in one place, ensuring consistency and reducing the risk of errors across the Stake DAO codebase.
- **Automation:**
  Scripts in this package generate machine- and human-readable address books for use in documentation, monitoring, and integrations.
- **Reference:**
  Other smart contract packages and off-chain tools should import addresses from here, not hardcode them elsewhere.

## üìÇ Where to find the address book library files

- All Solidity address book libraries are located in [`src/`](./src/).
- Each file corresponds to a protocol and network, and may contain multiple libraries for different products or sections (e.g., Protocol, Locker, Votemarket).
- Example:
  - `CurveEthereum.sol` ‚Äî Curve protocol addresses on Ethereum
  - `SpectraBase.sol` ‚Äî Spectra protocol addresses on Base
  - `DaoEthereum.sol` ‚Äî DAO addresses on Ethereum

## üõ†Ô∏è Scripts

The [`scripts/`](./scripts/) directory contains automation tools for generating address book outputs:

- **`generate-json-book.js`**
  Scans all Solidity files in `src/`, extracts addresses, and outputs a hierarchical, machine-readable `address-book.json`.

  - Handles DAO and Common flattening
  - Resolves `CommonUniversal` references
  - Enforces conventions and reports errors

- **`generate-md-book.js`**
  Converts `address-book.json` into a human-friendly Markdown file (`generated/README.md`).
  - Organizes by protocol, network, and product
  - Flattens DAO and Common sections
  - Adds explorer links for each address
  - Includes an auto-generated warning

**Usage:**
Run the scripts sequentially from the package root:

```sh
pnpm run generate-json
pnpm run generate-md
```

## üìë Output

- **`generated/address-book.json`** ‚Äî Machine-readable, hierarchical address book for programmatic use.
- **`generated/README.md`** ‚Äî Human-friendly Markdown address book for documentation and review.

## üß© Contributing

To contribute to the address book, please follow these guidelines:

- **Add new addresses** by creating or updating the appropriate file in `src/` following the conventions below.
- **Do NOT run the scripts manually.** The output files are git-ignored and will be generated automatically by the CI pipeline on every relevant change.
- **Review your Solidity changes locally.** Generated outputs will be uploaded and distributed by CI for documentation and integration purposes.

### ‚úÖ DOs and ‚ùå DON'Ts

#### ‚úÖ DOs

- **Follow the filename convention:**
  `ProtocolNetwork.sol` (e.g., `CurveEthereum.sol`, `DaoBsc.sol`, `CommonPolygon.sol`)
- **Use the correct structure:**
  Each file may define one or more Solidity `library` contracts, typically grouped by protocol and product (e.g., `library BalancerProtocol { ... }`, `library BalancerLocker { ... }`).
  The file name should follow the `ProtocolNetwork.sol` convention, but the libraries inside may be named `{Protocol}{Product}` or similar.
- **Declare all addresses as `address internal constant`:**
  ```solidity
  address internal constant TOKEN = 0x...;
  ```
- **Capitalize all address labels:**
  Use uppercase for all label names (e.g., `TOKEN`, `LOCKER`, `GAUGE_CONTROLLER`).
- **Group addresses logically:**
  By protocol, network, and product as appropriate, using separate libraries within the same file if needed.
- **Keep the structure flat for DAO and Common files:**
  No product-level nesting; just a mapping of labels to addresses.
- **Document any special cases or placeholders.**

#### ‚ùå DON'Ts

- **Don't use non-standard naming or structure:**
  The scripts rely on strict conventions for parsing.
- **Don't use non-constant or non-internal variables:**
  Only `address internal constant` is supported.
- **Don't use lowercase or mixed-case for labels:**
  Always use uppercase.
- **Don't add unrelated logic or functions:**
  These files are for address constants only.
- **Don't duplicate addresses across files unless necessary.**

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Additional Notes

- **This package is the single source of truth for all Stake DAO addresses.**
  All other packages and integrations should reference addresses from here.
- **For questions or issues, open an issue or contact the Stake DAO engineering team.**
