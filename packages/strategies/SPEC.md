# Stake DAO V2 â€” System Specification

## 1. System Architecture Overview

Stake DAO V2 is a modular, gas-efficient yield optimization protocol designed to source rewards from various DeFi platforms (Curve, Balancer, Pendle, etc.) while providing a unified user experience. The system employs a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns to enable flexible reward streaming, multi-chain deployment, and seamless protocol integrations.

### Core Design Principles

1. **Modularity**: Each component has a single responsibility and well-defined interfaces
2. **Gas Efficiency**: Optimized storage layouts and integral-based reward calculations
3. **Extensibility**: Protocol-agnostic design allows for easy integration with new yield sources
4. **Security**: Multi-layered permission system and emergency shutdown capabilities

## 2. Core Components

### 2.2 Vaults (RewardVault)

Vaults are the primary user entry points for depositing and withdrawing assets.

**Key Responsibilities:**

### 2.3 Allocator

The Allocator determines the optimal distribution of deposited funds across multiple yield strategies.

**Key Responsibilities:**

## 3. Core Processes

### 3.1 Reward Distribution Mechanism

Stake DAO V2 implements a dual reward stream system to balance immediate reward availability with gas efficiency.

#### 3.1.1 Checkpoint Rewards

Checkpoint rewards are processed immediately upon user actions (deposit, withdrawal, or transfer).

**Process Flow:**
1. User performs an action (deposit, withdrawal, or transfer)
2. Vault calls Accountant.checkpoint() with the action details
3. Accountant updates the reward integral and user balances
4. User can immediately claim accrued rewards

**Technical Details:**
- Uses integral-based accounting for precise reward calculation
- Processes rewards with minimal gas overhead
- Updates user-specific reward state on each action

#### 3.1.2 Harvested Rewards

Harvested rewards are batch-processed when gas-efficient, according to governance-defined thresholds.

**Process Flow:**
1. Pending rewards accumulate in the Accountant
2. When rewards reach the threshold (or fees are acceptable), a harvest operation is triggered
3. Strategy claims rewards from external protocols
4. Accountant distributes rewards to users based on their share of the vault

**Technical Details:**
- Implements dynamic harvest fee based on reward balance
- Uses PendingRewards structure to track reward amounts
- Separates fee-subject amounts from total reward amounts

### 3.2 Fee Structure

The protocol implements a flexible fee structure with dynamic and fixed components.

#### 3.2.1 Harvest Fee (0-0.5%)

The harvest fee varies dynamically based on the current rewards balance:

**Calculation:**
- If rewards are below the HARVEST_URGENCY_THRESHOLD, fee scales linearly from 0.5% to 0%
- If rewards exceed the threshold, fee remains at 0%
- If threshold is set to 0, maximum fee (0.5%) always applies

**Purpose:**
- Incentivizes timely harvesting when rewards accumulate
- Reduces fees when harvesting is less urgent

#### 3.2.2 Protocol Fee (15%)

Fixed fee applied to all rewards to fund protocol operations and development.

**Implementation:**
- Applied to fee-subject amounts only
- Accrued in the Accountant contract
- Claimable by the designated fee receiver

#### 3.2.3 Fee Cap (40%)

All fees combined (harvest + protocol) cannot exceed 40% of rewards.

### 3.3 Deposit Flow

**Process Flow:**
1. User deposits tokens into a Vault
2. Vault updates reward state via Accountant.checkpoint()
3. Vault consults Allocator to determine optimal asset distribution
4. Assets are transferred to the designated targets
5. Strategy executes deposit operations through protocol-specific implementations
6. Vault mints shares to the user

**Technical Details:**
- Uses ERC4626 standard for deposits
- Implements allocation-based deposit strategy
- Updates reward state before processing deposit

### 3.4 Withdrawal Flow

**Process Flow:**
1. User requests withdrawal from a Vault
2. Vault updates reward state via Accountant.checkpoint()
3. Vault consults Allocator to determine withdrawal sources
4. Strategy executes withdrawal operations through protocol-specific implementations
5. Assets are transferred to the user
6. Vault burns shares from the user

**Technical Details:**
- Uses ERC4626 standard for withdrawals
- Implements allocation-based withdrawal strategy
- Updates reward state before processing withdrawal

### 3.5 Harvest Mechanism

**Process Flow:**
1. Harvester reviews pending rewards in the Accountant
2. Based on reward balance, harvest fee is calculated
3. Strategy harvests rewards from external protocols
4. Accountant processes rewards, deducting fees
5. Users can claim their share of rewards

**Technical Details:**
- Implements batch harvesting for gas efficiency
- Uses dynamic fee calculation based on reward balance
- Separates fee-subject amounts from total reward amounts
